# Calculator (AI Generated)
Create a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator should have a dark theme, a digital display screen, buttons for all numbers (0-9), basic operations (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=). The JavaScript code should handle all the logic for calculations
